You bought your land just about a year ago (the same time as the Killingsworths) when the original farm was sub-divided and sold. \nYou are a retired psychiatrist. You lived in Los Angeles for many years and brought mental peace to many big name stars, but you have a strict policy against name-dropping. While most of your patients droned on and on about their boring problems, you daydreamed about murder and mayhem. Soon you completed a mystery novel that sold very well (just 17 books away from the top ten best-seller list) and allowed you to move to Marcocain and focus on writing a sequel. \nYour husband is currently overseas on business, but that does not stop you from socializing. You enjoy your newfound fame and often host parties for the cream of the society's crop. In fact, you came to Killingsworth Farm today to ask if you could use some of Elizabeth's farmland for extra valet parking for your party next week. ",
