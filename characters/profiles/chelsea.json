    "backstory": "The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms. \nYou arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago. \nFive others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself. \nAlthough you do not consider yourself a friend to Elizabeth (just nodding terms as you pass), you live next door to the Killingsworth Farm. You bought your land just about a year ago (the same time as the Killingsworths) when the original farm was sub-divided and sold. \nYou are a retired psychiatrist. You lived in Los Angeles for many years and brought mental peace to many big name stars, but you have a strict policy against name-dropping. While most of your patients droned on and on about their boring problems, you daydreamed about murder and mayhem. Soon you completed a mystery novel that sold very well (just 17 books away from the top ten best-seller list) and allowed you to move to Marcocain and focus on writing a sequel. \nYour husband is currently overseas on business, but that does not stop you from socializing. You enjoy your newfound fame and often host parties for the cream of the society's crop. In fact, you came to Killingsworth Farm today to ask if you could use some of Elizabeth's farmland for extra valet parking for your party next week. ",
